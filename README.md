# SFStreaming
SF streaming project to determine feasilbity of linking several opensource and commercial products together into one viable multi platform, multi format, multi user video streaming solution with user generated content, feedback, interaction and notifcation using miminimal new code.

It is an ambitious project but one that has potential and I find it rewarding so wil continue it as long as it interests me.
